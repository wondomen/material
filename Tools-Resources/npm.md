# npm "Node Package Manager."

### `npm`

`npm` stands for "Node Package Manager." It is a package manager and dependency management tool that is primarily used for JavaScript and Node.js applications. npm allows developers to easily install, share, and manage third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools, known as packages or modules, that are essential for building and maintaining software projects.

Key features and functions of npm include:

1. **Package Installation:** npm enables developers to easily install packages from the npm registry into their projects. By using a simple command like `npm install <package-name>`, developers can quickly add external libraries to their codebase.

2. **Dependency Resolution:** When a package is installed, npm automatically resolves and installs its dependencies, ensuring that the required packages are present and compatible with each other.

3. **Version Management:** npm allows specifying package versions, including specific versions, version ranges, or using semantic versioning (SemVer). This ensures consistent behavior and avoids unexpected changes when new versions are released.

4. **Package Publishing:** Developers can also publish their own packages to the npm registry, making them available for others to use. This feature encourages collaboration and sharing within the developer community.

5. **Scripts and Automation:** npm includes a scripting feature that allows developers to define and run custom scripts. These scripts can automate tasks like building, testing, and deployment, streamlining development workflows.

6. **Project Configuration:** The `package.json` file is a central configuration file for npm-managed projects. It contains metadata about the project, its dependencies, scripts, and other project-specific settings.

7. **Global and Local Packages:** npm distinguishes between global and local packages. Global packages are installed globally on your system and can be accessed from the command line. Local packages are installed within a specific project and are listed in the project's `package.json` file.

8. **Updating Packages:** npm provides commands to update packages to their latest versions, respecting version constraints defined in the `package.json`.

9. **Semantic Versioning:** npm uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to manage package versioning. This helps developers understand the significance of version updates and ensures compatibility between different packages.

npm is a vital tool for JavaScript and Node.js developers. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, automates tasks, and fosters collaboration by making it easy to share code and build on existing solutions. Whether you're working on a small project or a large-scale application, npm plays a crucial role in maintaining a well-organized and efficient development workflow.

### `npx`

`npm` and `npx` are both command-line tools that come with Node.js, but they serve different purposes:

1. **npm (Node Package Manager):**
   - `npm` is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, manage, and publish packages or modules (libraries) that you can use in your Node.js projects.
   - With `npm`, you typically install packages globally (available for all projects) or locally (within a specific project). Global packages are often command-line tools that you can use across different projects.
   - Example commands:
     - To install a package globally: `npm install -g package-name`
     - To install a package locally: `npm install package-name`

2. **npx (Node Package Executer):**
   - `npx` is a tool that comes bundled with `npm` (version 5.2.0 and above). It's used to execute packages or binaries that are not globally installed on your system.
   - The primary advantage of `npx` is that it allows you to run commands from packages that you don't want to install globally or locally. It fetches the package from the npm registry, runs the command, and then removes the temporary package.
   - Example commands:
     - Run a package without installing it: `npx package-name`
     - Execute a specific binary from a package: `npx package-name binary-name`

Both `npm` and `npx` are related to package management in Node.js, `npm` is used to install and manage packages, while `npx` is used to run commands from packages without the need to install them globally or locally.
